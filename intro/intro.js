/**
 #if you are coming to javascript from another programming language then you already know that #that a programmers journey always starts with the classic "hello world" which we shall write #shortly :-). If you are however coming to computer programming for the very first time, and #this lesson is the first, dont worry, this course is intended provide the learner with all #the tools, knowledge and skills to persue a career in software development using the #javaScript programming language.
 #
 #
 #In order to follow along, please ensure you have the appropriate tools to help you follow #along and practice your javaScript. The Following tools are reccomended:
 # 1. Smart Phone (optional)
 # 2. Laptop or Desktop Computer or anything relatively similar (reccommended but optonal if #you have a smart phone)
 # 3. Web Browser to help you execute/run the javascript (reccomended)
 # 4. Editor to help you write the JavaScript code to files . a simple text editor will do but #i highly reccomend any one of the following as they will provide with some pretty cool tools #to use as you develop your software : Sublime Text(https://www.sublimetext.com/3) , vsCode
 #(https://code.visualstudio.com/download), Atom(https://atom.io/). ps:sublime editor rocks :-)
 #
 #
 # if you need to get any of the tools above, please go ahead, i will wait......:-)

/**
 * LETS SAY "HELLO WORLD" :-)
 * Before You even get to write your first "hello world" program, its important to understand 
 * what the programming langiage is capable of doing.
 * I must assume that for you to get to this page, you must have obviusly clicked some button,
 * seen a pop-up on the screen asking you to sign up for some newsletter or just seen some 
 * fancy effects like pictures switching on a website dashboard after a particluar period of
 * time. If you have experienced atleast one of the above, then you have experienced the power 
 * of javaScript.
 * JavScript is used to make web pages interactive e.g change color of a button when it clicked,
 *  bring up a pop-up on the screen etc. with that being said, lets get started and write our
 *  first computer program. yeaaaaah :-)
 * 
 * =>open your web browser on your computer.
 * =>right click on and chose "inspect element" or "ctr shift Q",
 * =>you will see a small window show up
 * =>click on console . we will use this console for now.
 * =>NOTE: this is most basic setup option available, later on in the course you will learn how
 *  to use other runtimes/platforms other than the broswer console to execute javacscript code
 *
 * 
 * 
 * our first program will just help us print something to the screen, a simple message to just
 *  let the world know that we have started learning javaScript Programming Langauge.
 * in the console, write the following line of code and press enter:
 * => alert("Hello world! i am learning javascript");
 * 
 * # have you pressed enter ? what do you see  ? isnt that cool ? : -) 
 * 
 * what about when we want to write something to the console apart from creating a dailog as in the above example? 
 * in order to print words to the screen, we use another cool feature called 
 * "console". like the function "alert" , console is freely available in javascript. these 
 * featuresthat are made available by the langauge itself are called "global" features. you do
 *  not need to do anything specail in order to gain access to these features.
 *  
 * =>console.log("hello world")
 * 
 * That wasnt Hard now, was it  ? 
 * 
 * Thanks for taking the time to read through the introduction of our free online javascript 
 * lessons. 
 * 
 * Next : DATATYPES
