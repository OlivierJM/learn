### Why learn Javascript  

>  `Javascript`  is a programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages.
>  [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript)

**Javascript** is a powerful dynamic language that was created to add interactivity to web pages and make them more dynamic, while this is still valid and very true, Javascript now runs way beyond browsers, you can now use Javascript to create mobile applications, you can create complex user interfaces, you can use it on the backend to do complex tasks including connecting to the database and others. 

Javascript is an easy and fun language to learn, this is because it doesn't force you to things in a certain way, Javascript doesn't force you to use Object Oriented Programming or Functional programming or any other programming paradigm, but it still makes it possible to use any of these in case you decide to. 


### how to get the best out this
We will learn the basics of the language in a light way, a way that makes it easy for someone who has never touched code to find it helpful and easy to approach, the best way to learn is by doing, this is why we are including small exercises and little projects in each topic to help you check the understanding, you can always reach out to ask for help, this is the reason why this repo exists, it is to help you learn in a personalised way, we promise to answer most questions you will find, just go ahead and create an [issue here](https://github.com/OlivierJM/learn-js/issues) 

Start from the structure mentioned [here](https://github.com/OlivierJM/learn-js#structure-order) in the readme, read through the notes found there and if there is anything that doesn't; t make sense for you, reach out to ask a question, do the exercise to prove your understanding, these are self-paced and won't be marked, run the test to make sure that you have done the exercises well.
